# Developing Interoperable Application Ontologies

Building an application ontology that is truly interoperable requires more than just defining concepts and relationships—it demands a structured approach that ensures compatibility and integration across different ontologies and systems. By following established guidelines and using common design patterns, developers can create ontologies that are consistent, reusable, and capable of working seamlessly in collaborative and cross-disciplinary environments.

To support ontology developers in this process, we provide two comprehensive resources:

- **General Guide for Collaborative Ontology Development**  
  A step-by-step guide to best practices in collaborative ontology design, ensuring consistency and interoperability across domains. [Access the guide](https://scientific-ontology-network.github.io/)

- **Materials Science & PMDco Specific Guide**  
  Tailored guidance for ontology development within the context of materials science and PMDco, including recommended workflows and alignment principles. [Access the guide](https://materialdigital.github.io/core-ontology/docs/PMDco%20User%20Guide/#how-to-develop-your-application-ontologies-using-pmdco-and-oboodk-best-practices)

By following these resources, developers can create application ontologies that are not only robust and consistent but also integrable with other ontologies in the field.
