# Semantic Interoperability Group

The **Semantic Interoperability Group** aims to describe materials and the processes used to create and transform them. Achieving this requires a shared vocabulary and a common understanding among researchers, engineers, and data managers. Ontologies serve as semantic artifacts that provide this vocabulary and come with a rich logical framework that enables defining constraints, rules, and validation mechanisms for material-related descriptions.

## How to use an ontology and patterns to describe something?

Many description workflows follow recurrent structures. To support users, we provide a set of pre-existing patterns that cover different aspects of materials and material processes. These patterns are designed to be accessible and usable even with minimal prior knowledge of ontologies. You can start by exploring our [user story for data annotation](sites/userstory-annotation.md) if you want to learn how to use ontologies and patterns to describe materials and their related processes. We are currently also developing a Pattern Store, where you can search and reuse existing patterns that have been developed and reviewed by experts.

## Which ontologies are there?

A collection of existing ontologies is available through the [Ontology Portal](https://matportal.org/ontologies), where you can explore domain ontologies curated and maintained by the group and its collaborators. To ensure compatibility across domains, the [PMD core ontolgy][PMDco-docs] acts as a mediation ontology, aligning different conceptualizations -- this is more advanced but essential for long-term interoperability.

## How to build something new?

### Developing a new ontology

If you plan to create a new ontology within the materials domain, several onboarding resources are available. Start with the [Ontology Development Guide](https://scientific-ontology-network.github.io/) for newcomers, which outlines basic principles, methodology, and best practices. Your ontology should align with the PMDco ontology and follow the recommendations from the [Application Ontology Guide](sites/application-ontology-guide.md).

If you are an experienced ontology developer, you can also contribute to PMDco directly. The ontology is openly developed, maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology), and [fully documented][PMDco-docs].

### Developing a new pattern

Patterns help standardize how materials and processes are described. If existing patterns do not match your needs, you can design new ones. To this end, we are currently aiming to develop a "Pattern Workshop" where community members collaborate to discuss, refine, and integrate new modeling solutions.
